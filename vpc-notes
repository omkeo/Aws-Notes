1.	What is VPC?
-> In simple terms, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like a private network in the cloud. 
  It lets you create a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud where you can launch and run your resources.

2.	What are Subnets when working with VPC?
-> Subnets are smaller segments of a VPC. Think of them as divisions within your private cloud. 
  They help you organize and manage your resources effectively,
  allowing you to control traffic flow and apply security measures.

3.	What is NAT Device?
->	A Network Address Translation (NAT) device helps your private resources in the VPC access the internet while keeping their individual identities hidden. 
  It acts like a translator, allowing your internal resources to communicate with the internet without exposing their private addresses.
  
4.	Difference between stateful & stateless filtering?
-> Stateful filtering remembers the state of the connection and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic. 
  Stateless filtering, on the other hand, evaluates each packet individually without considering the context of previous packets.
  
5.	Advantages of using default VPC?
->	The default VPC simplifies the setup process by providing a pre-configured network. 
  It's convenient for beginners as it eliminates the need for manual configuration, making it easier to launch resources quickly.
    
6.	What is the internet gateway in VPC?
-> An internet gateway is a connection point that allows your VPC to communicate with the internet. 
    It enables resources in your VPC to access the internet and vice versa.
    
7.	What is Network ACL in VPC?
-> Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) are like virtual firewalls that control traffic at the subnet level in your VPC. 
  They allow or deny traffic based on rules you define.
    
8.	What is the Security Group in VPC?
-> A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level. 
  It controls inbound and outbound traffic for your instances, providing an additional layer of security.
    
9.	What is an Elastic IP Address in VPC, and why use it?
->	An Elastic IP is a static public IP address that you can attach to your instances. 
    It's useful when you want a fixed address for services like a website, 
   and it helps in case of instance failure, allowing you to quickly redirect traffic to a new instance.
     
10.	Can we attach one Production Elastic IP to a new Prod server?
->	Yes, you can attach a production Elastic IP to a new production server. 
    This is useful for maintaining a consistent public IP address for your service even if you replace or upgrade the underlying server.
      
11.	How does ELB Affect a VPC?
->	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances, 
  enhancing the availability and fault tolerance of your applications in the VPC.
      
12.	Limitations of VPCs, Gateway, and Subnets?
->	VPCs have limits on the number of resources you can create. 
  Gateways and subnets may have limitations on the number of connections and size. 
  It's essential to be aware of these limits to plan your architecture effectively.
      
13.	What is a Public IP Address and why use it?
-> A Public IP Address is an address on the internet that can be accessed publicly. 
  It's used for resources that need to be directly reachable from the internet, like web servers.
    
14.	Explain Bastion Host Concept?
->	A Bastion Host is a server that acts as a secure gateway between your internal network and the internet. 
  It provides a controlled entry point for accessing your private resources, adding an extra layer of security.
    
15.	When do we need to create a new customized VPC?
->	You might create a custom VPC when you need specific network configurations that the default VPC doesn't offer,
  or when you want more control over your network architecture.
  
16.	What is Peering? Why peer at two VPCs?
-> Peering is connecting two VPCs to allow them to communicate with each other as if they are on the same network. 
It's useful for sharing resources, data, or services between different VPCs.
  
17.	What is VPN, Where do we use VPN Tunnel?
->	VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet. 
  VPN tunnels are used to connect remote networks or users securely to a private network, such as connecting your on-premises data center to your VPC.
