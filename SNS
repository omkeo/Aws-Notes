  such as HTTP, HTTPS, email, SMS, and more.

2.Why do we use SNS?

4.Difference between Amazon SNS & Amazon SQS?
->Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is used for push notifications, 
  allowing messages to be broadcast to multiple subscribers simultaneously. 

  Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that decouples the components of a cloud application, 
  allowing them to operate independently. SNS is typically used for event notification, while SQS is used for message queuing.


5.What are the different delivery formats and transports in AWS SNS?

  Transports include protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, Email/Email-JSON, Amazon SQS, 
  SMS, and application protocols like Amazon Lambda and mobile push notifications.

6.What is the difference between SNS FIFO & Standard while creating the SNS topic?
->SNS supports both FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and Standard topics. 
  FIFO topics provide message order and exactly-once processing, ensuring that messages are delivered in the order they are sent. 
  Standard topics do not guarantee message order but offer higher throughput.

7.On which services are configured with AWS SNS?
->AWS SNS can be configured with various AWS services, including Lambda functions, SQS queues, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, email, SMS, and more.

10. What is SNS Mobile Push?
-> SNS Mobile Push allows you to send push notifications to mobile devices (iOS, Android, etc.) through SNS. 
   It simplifies the process of sending notifications to mobile apps, making it easier for developers to implement push functionality.

11. On which delivery method do we use and configure the subscription?
