--------------------EC2-------------------------------

Q1-What is EC2, Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?
->It's a web service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
 Essentially, it allows users to rent virtual computers on which they can run their own applications.

Q2- Features of Amazon EC2 ?
->1-Scalable compute capacity.
  2-Various instance types for diverse needs.
  3-Persistent storage options.
  4-Integrated with other AWS services.
  5-Security groups and key pairs for access control.

Q3-What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
->Hypervisor is a software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).
 Types:
 Type 1 (Bare Metal Hypervisors): Directly installed on the host's hardware.
 Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisors): Installed on top of an operating system.

Q4-Where we use hypervisor?
->In virtualization environments, to create and manage virtual machines.

Q5-Steps to create an EC2 instance?
->1-Sign in to AWS Management Console.
  2-Navigate to EC2.
  3-Launch Instance.
  4-Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
  5-Choose an instance type.
  6-Configure instance details.
  7-Add storage.
  8-Configure security groups and key pairs.
  9-Launch the instance.

Q6-EC2 Instance state?
->Represents the state of the EC2 instance, such as running, stopped, terminated,stopping.

Q7-How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes ?
->the states are: pending,running,shutting-down,terminated,stopping,and stopped.

Q8- What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ? ?
->It's a state where the server's state is saved to disk and the server is powered off. When restarted, it resumes from where it left off.

Q9-What is KMS ? 
->Key Management Service is an AWS service that makes it easier to create and manage cryptographic keys used to encrypt data.

Q10-AWS Amazon EC2 Instance types ?
-> Examples include t2.micro, m5.large, c5.xlarge, etc., each designed for specific workload requirements.

Q11- How many types of status checks happen in aws ?
->there are two types: system status checks and instance status checks, ensuring that the instance is reachable and functioning properly.

Q12- When we see the global view option in ec2 service ?
->Allows users to view all their EC2 resources across different regions in a unified view.

Q13-When we logged into the cloud account by default why do we always jump into the north
virginia region, why it’s most popular ?
->North Virginia region It's one of AWS's oldest and most populated regions, offering a wide range of services and features.
  IT is popular becz it has heigest AZ's zone 

Q14- What are EBS Volumes and its types ?
->They are block-level storage volumes attached to EC2 instances.
 Types include General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), Throughput Optimized (HDD), and Cold HDD.

Q15-Purpose of Using EBS volumes ?
->To provide persistent storage that can be attached to EC2 instances.

Q16-Purchasing options in AWS EC2:
->On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.

Q17-Difference between AWS AMI Image & AWS Template ?
->AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains software configuration and other settings.
 A template (like CloudFormation) describes AWS resources and their configurations.

Q18- What is NIC & it’s types ?
->Hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network. 
  Types include wired and wireless.

Q19- What is elastic IP ? & WHY were we used ?
->A static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
  It's used when you want a fixed IP address that can be quickly remapped to different instances.

Q20- What is the snapshot ? why we use it ?
->A point-in-time copy of an EBS volume.
 Used for backups, replication, and disaster recovery.

Q21- How can we save money in snapshot costing, if an automated snapshot has been created ?
->Saving money in snapshot costing: By deleting unused snapshots, setting up retention policies,
  or using automation to manage snapshot creation and deletion.

Q22-What is the lifecycle manager in snapshot ?
->Allows users to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS volume snapshots.

Q23-. How does the Amazon lifecycle manager work ?
->Automates routine tasks like backups, retention, and deletion of resources like EBS volumes.

Q23-Difference between Security Group & NACL ? 
->Security Groups are stateful and act as a firewall for EC2 instances. 
NACLs are stateless and control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

Q24-. What are NACL & Its types ?
->Network Access Control Lists. 
Types include inbound and outbound rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP protocol, port number, and source/destination IP.

Q25-. How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
->You can attach one primary private IP per network interface and multiple secondary private IPs. 
   Elastic IPs can also be attached.

Q26-How many types of volume states do we have ?
->Available, in-use, creating, deleting, and error.

Q27-. What is a key pair, and its types ?
->A set of public and private keys used for secure access to EC2 instances. 
Types include EC2 Instance Key Pairs and EC2 Key Pairs for Windows.

Q28- What is load balancer and its types ?
-> Distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets. 
  Types: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer (CLB).

Q29-. How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
->Distributes traffic to instances based on configured algorithms 
1-round-robin distribute the traffic in into circular load balancer with
 static load balancing without any priority.

2-least connection will distribute the traffic when server have least
  engaged connection with server.

3-Least time will distribute the traffic to those server,who have less response time

Q30- Features of Load Balancers ?
->High availability, automatic scaling, SSL termination, and health checks.

Q31- What is ASG ? & Its types ? 
->ASGis  the number of EC2 instances in a group matches a desired count.
 Types include Launch Configuration and Launch Templates.

Q32-What is a Health Check ?
->A periodic check performed by load balancers to ensure instances are healthy and can handle traffic.

Q33-. What is the threshold ?
->A value set for health checks or alarms that, when exceeded, triggers actions.

Q34-What is the group of LB ?
->Refers to the group of load balancers that perform the distribution of incoming traffic.

Q35-Why do we prefer ALB over ALB ?
->ALB operates at the application layer and is ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
 NLB operates at the transport layer and is designed for TCP/UDP traffic.

Q36- Difference between Web server & Application server ? 
->Web servers handle HTTP requests and return responses. 
Application servers run application logic and interface between the data and the web server.

Q37- What is the target group ?
->A logical grouping of targets (instances) registered with a load balancer for routing requests.

Q38-What is the desired capacity in ASG ? 
->The number of EC2 instances that should be running in the group.

Q39- How many types of the Scaling option ?
->Manual scaling, scheduled scaling, and dynamic scaling.

Q40- Scaling plans ?
Pre-defined scaling strategies for ASG, such as target tracking, step scaling, and simple scaling.

Q41-Types of Auto Scaling ?
->Scaling based on demand, scheduled scaling, and predictive scaling.

Q42-Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
Vertical scaling (or scaling up) involves adding resources to an existing instance.
                 Used by developer.

Horizontal scaling (or scaling out) involves adding more instances to distribute the load.
                  Used by Production for creating replica's

Q42-Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
An AMI is a template for EC2 instances. 
A snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume.

Q43-What is Difference between EBS/EFS/S3 ?
-> 
  -EBS: Block storage attached to EC2 instances.
  - EFS: Managed NFS file system service.
  - S3: Object storage service for storing and retrieving data.
